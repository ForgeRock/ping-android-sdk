# Ping Sample App

A comprehensive sample application demonstrating the integration of multiple Ping Identity SDK features in a single, unified application. This app serves as a reference implementation combining authentication flows, MFA capabilities, device management, and developer tools.

## Overview

The Ping Sample App is a consolidated sample that brings together functionality from multiple standalone samples (Journey, DaVinci, OIDC, and Authenticator) into one cohesive application. It demonstrates best practices for building production-ready Android applications with the Ping Identity SDK.

## Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication
- **Journey Flow**: ForgeRock Journey-based authentication with callback rendering
- **DaVinci Flow**: PingOne DaVinci authentication flows
- **OIDC Login**: OpenID Connect web authentication

### 👤 User Management
- **User Profile**: View and display user information with JSON toggle
- **Access Token**: View, refresh, and revoke access tokens with formatted JSON display
- **Device Management**: Register, view, edit, and delete trusted devices
- **Logout**: Comprehensive logout with session management (Journey, DaVinci, OIDC)

### 🔑 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **OATH (TOTP/HOTP)**: 
  - QR code scanning for account registration
  - Manual account entry
  - Time-based and counter-based OTP generation
  - Account grouping by issuer
- **Push Notifications**:
  - Push authentication registration
  - Notification history and management
  - Biometric authentication support
  - Challenge verification
- **QR Scanner**: Integrated camera-based QR code scanning

### 🛠️ Developer Tools
- **Configuration**: Environment selection (Staging/Snapshot) with custom URL support
- **Device Information**: Comprehensive device data collection and display
- **Diagnostic Logging**: View application logs for debugging

## Architecture

### Application Structure

The app follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
PingSampleApp
├── Authentication Flows (Journey, DaVinci, OIDC)
├── User Management (Profile, Token, Device, Logout)
├── MFA Features (OATH, Push, QR Scanner)
├── Developer Tools (Config, Device Info, Logger)
└── Shared Components (Navigation, Theme, Config)
```

### Key Components

#### 1. **PingSampleApplication**
Application-level initialization and dependency management:
- Initializes SDK clients (OATH, Push)
- Creates and manages managers (OathManager, PushManager, JourneyManager)
- Provides application-scoped AuthenticatorViewModel
- Handles Firebase Cloud Messaging setup

#### 2. **Navigation System**
Centralized navigation with proper screen routing:
- Home screen with categorized feature access
- Deep linking support for authentication flows
- Back navigation handling
- Screen-specific ViewModels

#### 3. **Authenticator Integration**
Complete MFA functionality integrated from AuthenticatorApp:
- **Managers**: OathManager, PushManager, JourneyManager, AccountGroupingManager
- **UI Screens**: AccountsScreen, PushNotificationsScreen, QrScannerScreen, and more
- **Services**: PushNotificationService, LocationService
- **Notification Handlers**: BiometricPromptActivity, NotificationActionReceiver

#### 4. **Device Management**
Comprehensive device registration and management:
- Device registration with custom names
- Device list display with platform icons
- Device editing (rename)
- Device deletion with confirmation
- Automatic list refresh

#### 5. **Token Management**
Access token viewing and manipulation:
- Pretty-printed JSON display
- Token refresh functionality
- Token revocation
- Scrollable token view with dropdown menu

## Configuration

### Environment Setup

The app supports multiple environments configured via `EnvViewModel`:

1. **Staging Environment** (default)
2. **Snapshot Environment**
3. **Custom Configuration** (manual URL entry)

Configuration includes:
- Discovery endpoint URL
- Client ID
- Redirect URI
- Scopes
- Cookie name

### Firebase Setup

For Push notifications:
1. Add `google-services.json` to the app directory
2. Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging in Firebase Console
3. Enable push notifications in device settings

## Implementation Highlights

### ViewModel Initialization

The app uses application-level ViewModel initialization for the AuthenticatorViewModel:

```kotlin
// In PingSampleApplication
val authenticatorViewModel = AuthenticatorViewModel(
    application = this,
    userPreferences = userPreferences,
    oathManager = oathManager,
    pushManager = pushManager,
    accountGroupingManager = accountGroupingManager,
    testAccountFactory = testAccountFactory
)
```

Access pattern in Composables:
```kotlin
var authenticatorViewModel by remember { mutableStateOf<AuthenticatorViewModel?>(null) }

LaunchedEffect(Unit) {
    authenticatorViewModel = PingSampleApplication.getAuthenticatorViewModel()
}

authenticatorViewModel?.let { viewModel ->
    // Use ViewModel
}
```

### Device Management Pattern

Device operations follow a consistent pattern:

```kotlin
// Register Device
deviceClient.register(deviceName, deviceType, pushToken)

// Edit Device
deviceClient.update(deviceId, newName, ifMatch)

// Delete Device
deviceClient.delete(deviceId)

// List Devices
deviceClient.devices()
```

### Token Display with State Flow

Token formatting uses reactive StateFlow pattern:

```kotlin
val formattedToken = state.map { tokenState ->
    tokenState.token?.let {
        json.encodeToString(Token.serializer(), it)
    } ?: "No token available"
}
```

### Logout Session Management

Supports multiple simultaneous sessions:

```kotlin
// Check active sessions
val hasActiveSessions = state.journey || state.daVinci || state.oidc

// Logout all sessions
fun logoutAll() {
    journey.user()?.logout()
    daVinci?.user()?.logout()
    web?.user()?.logout()
}
```

## Screen Organization

### Home Screen Categories

**AUTHENTICATION**
- DaVinci Flow
- Journey Flow
- OIDC Login

**USER MANAGEMENT**
- User Profile
- Access Token
- Device Management
- Logout

**MFA**
- QR Scanner
- OATH
- Push
- Push Notifications

**DEVELOPER TOOLS**
- Configuration
- Device Information
- Logger

## Dependencies

Key dependencies include:
- Ping Identity SDK modules (Journey, DaVinci, OIDC, MFA)
- Jetpack Compose for UI
- Navigation Component
- Firebase Cloud Messaging
- CameraX for QR scanning
- Biometric authentication
- Kotlinx Serialization

## Differences from Standalone Samples

### vs. AuthenticatorApp
- Integrated into main navigation (not standalone app)
- Shares application lifecycle with other features
- Uses PingSampleApplication instead of AuthenticatorApp
- Consistent theme with rest of the app

### vs. JourneyApp
- Journey flows accessible from main navigation
- Integrated with DaVinci and OIDC flows
- Shared user management features
- Combined logout functionality

### vs. App Sample
- Consolidated all features into single app
- Unified navigation structure
- Shared configuration system
- Common theme and styling

## Building and Running

1. Clone the repository
2. Add `google-services.json` for Firebase (optional, for push notifications)
3. Configure environment in app (Settings → Configuration)
4. Build and run:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :samples:pingsampleapp:assembleDebug
   ```

## Known Limitations

- Firebase configuration required for push notifications
- Some Journey flows may require specific backend configuration
- Device management requires authenticated session
- Location services used in push notifications require permissions

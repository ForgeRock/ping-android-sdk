/**
 * Tamper detector that identifies device compromise by examining filesystem mount permissions.
 *
 * This detector works by analyzing the output of the `mount` command to determine if
 * critical system directories are mounted with write permissions. On a secure Android device,
 * system directories should be mounted as read-only to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 *
 * The detector checks for read-write ("rw") mount options on the following critical paths:
 * - `/system` - Core Android system files
 * - `/system/bin` - System binary executables
 * - `/system/sbin` - System super-user binaries
 * - `/system/xbin` - Extended system binaries
 * - `/vendor/bin` - Vendor-specific binaries
 * - `/sbin` - System binaries directory
 * - `/etc` - System configuration files
 *
 * If any of these directories are mounted with write permissions, it typically indicates:
 * - The device has been rooted
 * - System partition has been remounted as writable
 * - Custom firmware or ROM is installed
 * - Security mechanisms have been bypassed
 *
 * The detector handles different Android SDK versions as the `mount` command output
 * format varies between Android Marshmallow (API 23) and later versions.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val detector = PermissionDetector()
 * val isTampered = detector.isTampered(context)
 *
 * // Or in analyze DSL:
 * val isTampered = analyze {
 *     detector {
 *         add(PermissionDetector())
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @since 1.0
 * @see TamperDetector

/**
 * Tamper detector that identifies device rooting by checking for root management APK files.
 *
 * This detector works by searching for APK files of popular root management applications
 * that are commonly installed in the system partition on rooted devices. Unlike package-based
 * detection that checks installed applications, this detector looks for the actual APK files
 * in system directories where they are typically placed by rooting tools.
 *
 * The detector checks for APK files of well-known root management applications:
 * - **Superuser.apk** - One of the original Android root management apps
 * - **SuperSU.apk** - Popular root access management application by Chainfire
 * - **magisk.apk** - Modern systemless root solution by topjohnwu
 *
 * These APK files are typically installed to `/system/app/` directory during the rooting
 * process and remain there even if the applications are hidden from the launcher or
 * package manager queries. This makes file-based detection more reliable than package-based
 * detection in some scenarios.
 *
 * The detection is performed by checking file existence in the filesystem, which:
 * - Can detect root apps even if they're hidden from package manager
 * - Works regardless of whether the apps are currently active
 * - Is difficult to bypass without modifying the filesystem directly
 * - Provides evidence of past rooting attempts even if tools were removed
 *
 * The scoring system returns a [Double] value:
 * - `1.0` indicates at least one root APK file was found (high confidence of tampering)
 * - `0.0` indicates no root APK files were found
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val detector = RootApkDetector()
 * val isTampered = detector.isTampered(context)
 *
 * // Or in analyze DSL:
 * val isTampered = analyze {
 *     detector {
 *         add(RootApkDetector())
 *     }
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * Pre-configured tamper detector that identifies device compromise by checking for root cloaking applications.
 *
 * This detector extends [PackageDetector] and specifically looks for installed packages of applications
 * designed to hide or cloak root access from other applications. The presence of these applications
 * is often a strong indicator that the device has been rooted, as they serve no purpose on unrooted devices.
 *
 * Root cloaking applications work by:
 * - Intercepting system calls that would reveal root access
 * - Hiding root binaries and files from detection
 * - Spoofing system properties to appear unrooted
 * - Blocking or modifying responses from root detection methods
 * - Using framework hooks (like Xposed) to manipulate app behavior
 *
 * The detector checks for the following categories of cloaking applications:
 *
 * **Direct Root Cloaking Tools:**
 * - RootCloak (com.devadvance.rootcloak) - Popular root hiding application
 * - RootCloak Plus (com.devadvance.rootcloakplus) - Enhanced version with more features
 * - Hide My Root (com.amphoras.hidemyroot) - Root concealment tool
 * - Hide My Root Ad-Free (com.amphoras.hidemyrootadfree) - Premium ad-free version
 * - Hide Root Premium (com.formyhm.hiderootPremium) - Commercial root hiding solution
 * - Hide Root (com.formyhm.hideroot) - Basic root hiding functionality
 *
 * **Framework-Based Cloaking:**
 * - Xposed Installer (de.robv.android.xposed.installer) - Framework for system modifications
 * - Substrate (com.saurik.substrate) - Runtime manipulation framework
 *
 * **Temporary Root Management:**
 * - Temp Root Remove (com.zachspong.temprootremovejb) - Temporary root access removal
 *
 * The presence of any of these applications suggests sophisticated attempts to hide device tampering,
 * which ironically makes them strong indicators of compromise.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val detector = RootCloakingAppDetector()
 * val isTampered = detector.isTampered(context)
 *
 * // Or in analyze DSL:
 * val isTampered = analyze {
 *     detector {
 *         add(RootCloakingAppDetector())
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see PackageDetector

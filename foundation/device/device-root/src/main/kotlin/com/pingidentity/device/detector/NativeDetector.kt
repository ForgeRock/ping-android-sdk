/**
 * Native JNI-based detector for identifying device tampering through file system checks.
 *
 * This detector extends [FileDetector] and uses native C/C++ code through JNI (Java Native Interface)
 * to perform more sophisticated and harder-to-bypass file existence checks. The native implementation
 * can potentially detect files even when Java-level file system access is restricted or monitored.
 *
 * The detector specifically looks for the "su" (superuser) binary, which is the primary indicator
 * of root access on Android devices. By using native code, it can:
 * - Bypass Java-level security restrictions
 * - Perform low-level file system operations
 * - Be more difficult for anti-detection tools to hook or bypass
 *
 * The native library "tool-file" must be available and properly linked for this detector to function.
 * If the library fails to load, the detector gracefully degrades and returns false for all checks.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val detector = NativeDetector()
 * val isTampered = detector.isTampered(context)
 * ```
 *
 * @since 1.0
 * @see FileDetector

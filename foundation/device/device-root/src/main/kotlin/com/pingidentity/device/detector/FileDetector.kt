/**
 * Abstract base class for detecting device tampering by checking for the presence of specific files.
 *
 * This detector works by searching for files that are commonly found on rooted or compromised devices
 * across various system directories. Subclasses must provide the list of suspicious filenames to
 * check for through the [getFilenames] method.
 *
 * The detector searches through a comprehensive list of system paths including:
 * - Standard system directories (/system/bin/, /system/xbin/)
 * - Root-specific locations (/su/bin/, /system/usr/we-need-root/)
 * - Local data directories (/data/local/, /data/local/bin/)
 * - Cache and development directories
 * - All paths from the system PATH environment variable
 *
 * Common files that might indicate tampering include:
 * - `su` (superuser binary)
 * - `busybox` (comprehensive Unix utilities)
 * - `magisk` (systemless root manager)
 * - Root management app binaries
 * - Custom recovery tools
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * class RootFileDetector : FileDetector() {
 *     override fun getFilenames(): List<String> {
 *         return listOf("su", "busybox", "magisk", "supersu")
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *

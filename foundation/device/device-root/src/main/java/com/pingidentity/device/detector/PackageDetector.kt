/**
 * Abstract base class for detecting device tampering by checking for the presence of specific installed packages.
 *
 * This detector works by examining the list of installed applications to identify packages that are commonly
 * associated with rooted devices, security tools, or other potentially compromising software. Subclasses must
 * provide the list of suspicious package names through the [getPackages] method.
 *
 * The detector uses the Android PackageManager to query for installed applications, which provides a reliable
 * way to detect software that might indicate device compromise. This method can detect:
 * - Root management applications (SuperSU, Magisk Manager, etc.)
 * - Security testing tools and penetration testing apps
 * - Emulator detection bypassing tools
 * - Custom recovery applications
 * - Developer tools that shouldn't be on production devices
 *
 * Common suspicious packages include:
 * - `eu.chainfire.supersu` (SuperSU root manager)
 * - `com.topjohnwu.magisk` (Magisk root manager)
 * - `com.koushikdutta.superuser` (Superuser root app)
 * - `com.zachspong.temprootremovejb` (Root removal tools)
 * - `com.ramdroid.appquarantine` (App quarantine tools)
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * class RootPackageDetector : PackageDetector() {
 *     override fun getPackages(): List<String> {
 *         return listOf(
 *             "eu.chainfire.supersu",
 *             "com.topjohnwu.magisk",
 *             "com.koushikdutta.superuser"
 *         )
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @since 1.0
